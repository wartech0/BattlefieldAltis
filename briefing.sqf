This is a trimmed down domination style coop mission for up to 12 players. 
It features similar gameplay as regular domination missions but with less players and AI involved. 
It is aimed at smaller groups of players who find the regular 40 player domination missions too big for a small team.
<br/><br/>
There are 4 different mission types that can be randomly generated:<br/>
1) Capture - destroy the enemy MHQ/radio tower and kill all enemy units in the area.<br/>
2) Defend - travel to the marked area and prepare your defences, then defend the area against enemy attack. 
If there are no more blue units in the area the mission fails. Once the area is defended 
clear the remaining enemies to win.<br/>
3) Assassinate - enemy officer is hiding somewhere in the marked area. Kill him to win.<br/>
4) Rescue - enemy is holding a friendly captive inside the marked area. Rescue end escort him back to your base to win.<br/>
<br/>Notes:<br/>
- at start of each mission an MHQ or radio tower is spawned in the target area<br/>
- destroying enemy MHQ/radio tower is required to win only in 'capture' mission but doing so will help in all mission types 
as enemy will no longer be able to call in reinforcements<br/>

- when a mission is completed all remaining enemy forces are deleted and new mission will be generated<br/>
